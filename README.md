# ChatbotMentalHealth
Project Title
Mental Health Chatbot – A web-based chatbot to assess and support users' mental well-being through guided conversation and tools like depression tests and mindfulness tips.

Description
This project is a Flask-based Mental Health Chatbot designed to provide users with a secure, supportive platform for self-evaluation and awareness around mental health issues. It features a depression assessment questionnaire, emergency SOS support, and options for users to explore topics related to mental well-being and mindfulness. With a responsive Bootstrap front-end and simple, engaging UI, it helps users track their emotions, seek help anonymously, and understand their mental state. The chatbot is intended for educational or supportive purposes and is not a substitute for clinical diagnosis.
